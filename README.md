## Overview
A terminal-based game of life recreated in C++.

It has been made to work only on a Linux terminal. If you really want to, you could easily make it work in a Windows terminal by making small display changes to `src/display.cpp`.

## Instructions
Run `make` to compile files and create an executable.<br/>
Run `./gameoflife` to start the program.
